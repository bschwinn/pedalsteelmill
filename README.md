Chord dictionary and chord chart for pedal steel guitar

## What it is
A pedal steel chord dictionary and chord charting tool that currently supports the fairly standard 
3 pedal and 5 lever E9 pedal steel setup.

## What it does
It allows the user to select a major or minor chord by name and see all the positions of that chord up and down the neck.
It also supports the notion of a chord chart where the user can add individual chord positions
to the chart to make a chord progression.  The chart can also be fully edited/re-ordered and
each chord can have it's neck position changed in place - this allows for you go econmize your lateral movement.

## Where it's going
Hoping to add these features:
- support for 7th chords
- support for C6th setups
- user customization of tunings
- user customization of guitar setups

Cheers.

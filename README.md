# pedalsteelmill
Pedalsteel guitar chord dictionary and chart maker

## What it is
Pedalsteelmill is both a chord dictionary and chord charting tool.  It currently supports the fairly standard 
3 pedal and 5 lever E9 pedal steel setup.  I built this to help me learn to play pedalsteel.

## What it does
Pedalsteelmill provides quick lookup of major or minor chords and shows all the positions of that chord up and down the neck.  It also supports the notion of a chord chart where the user can add multiple chords/positions
in sequence to make a chord progression.  The chart can also be fully edited/re-ordered and
each chord can have it's neck position changed in place - this should help to econmize your lateral movement.

## Where it's going
Hoping to add these features:
- support for 7th chords
- support for C6th setups
- user customization of tunings/setups

Cheers.

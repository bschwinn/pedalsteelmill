Chord dictionary and chord chart for pedal steel guitar

## What it is
A pedal steel chord dictionary and chord charting tool that currently supports the fairly standard 
3 pedal and 5 lever E9 pedal steel setup.

## What it does
It also supports the notion of a chord chart.  The user can add individual chord positions
to the chart to match a chord progression(s).  The chart can be fully edited and re-ordered - 
each chord can have it's neck position changed in place even.

## Where it's going
Hoping to add these features:
- support for 7th chords
- support for C6th setups
- user customization of tunings
- user customization of guitar setups

Cheers.
